            <h3>QUETTA: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf central parliamentary board, headed by Prime Minister Imran Khan, has withdrawn the party ticket awarded to business tycoon Abdul Qadir in Balochistan for the Senate election after strong opposition from the PTI provincial leadership and zonal heads.</h3>
            <p>The party high command decided to take back ticket from Abdul Qadir and nominated Zahoor Agha for the Senate election on a general seat, said Adviser to the Prime Minister Shahbaz Gill on Saturday. “Withdrawal of party ticket from Abdul Qadir is correct,” the adviser said, explaining that Mr Agha would be party candidate from Balochistan in the Senate election.

                Opposing the award of party ticket to Abdul Qadir, PTI’s provincial leadership argued that he did not belong to the PTI as he had been a member of the ruling Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) till last week.
                
                The party provincial spokesman Asif Tareen also confirmed to Dawn that Zahoor Agha would contest the Senate election on general seat from Balochistan as the party withdrew its ticket from Mr Qadir.</p>

            <h3>Two 11-week-old white tiger cubs that died at Lahore Zoo last month appear to have died of Covid-19,
                officials said.</h3>
            <p>The cubs died in the zoo on Jan 30, four days after beginning treatment for what officials thought was
                feline panleukopenia virus, a disease that zoo officials said is common in Pakistan and targets cats'
                immune system.

                But an autopsy found the cubs' lungs were badly damaged and they were suffering from severe infection,
                with pathologists concluding they died from Covid-19.

                Although no PCR test for the novel coronavirus was conducted, zoo deputy director Kiran Saleem told
                Reuters the zoo believes the cubs were the victims of the pandemic that has killed 12,276 people in
                Pakistan.</p>
